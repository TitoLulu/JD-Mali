# JD-Mali
MS SQL DBMS System for JD Mali. Helps tracks CDS number applications, processing, and notification to DBA 
and applicants at each stage of the journey
This was a project I consulted for JD MALI for my Advanced Database class. Follows concepts such as database system design, from conceptual design
to logical design, to implementation. It serves the purpose of notifying JD Mali where an application of CDS account is at any given moment,
also notify their clients of rejection or success of their application. It aims to promote efficiency in handling CDS accounts applications.
